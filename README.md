# Giphy API
Homework assignment using giphy API

I created a Star Trek themed animated gif site, that uses AJAX calls for getting JSON objects from the Giphy website.  Time was spent making it responsive and usable on the iPhone (found the iOS doesn't accept click events on certain CSS styling).  The user can type in another category to search, and will be presented with another set of 10 gifs.
